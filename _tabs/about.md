&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi! My name is Nathanial O'Dell, I graduted with a Bachelor in Mathetmatics and Statistics from Texas Tech University in 2024 and I am currently pursuing a Master of Public Health in Epidemiology at the University of Washington (Seattle). I have a special interest in the modeling of vector population dynamics and vector-borne illness distribution and the usage of these methods in understanding the biological and societal determinants of adverse health outcomes in at-risk populations. If that sounds like mumbo-jumbo, it's fair to just say I like using math to attempt to explain why vectors and the diseases they transmit exist and thrive where they do.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aim of this page is multifaceted; I hope for it serve as a CV that's updated seamlessly, and a place to house projects that I take on in my free time (most of which will revolve around various other data analysis puruits). The occassional--but hopefully not sparse!-- academic paper I contribute to will be uploaded and/or discussed here, as well.
